## Creating a "second attempt" latency survey using the 11 Study 1 categories (although some categories will be "grouped"): Linear, hooked, non-mono, hooked(n), Linear(n)

library(surveydown)


##surveydown objects

##grab raw data numbers and key numbers from new categorization
##remove i and _ numbers from the raw data
##put key categorization as unlist tall data - will need to do the same for the other data
##join them on number, then put back into a wide dataset and create objects for each of the categories 

#install.packages("reshape2")

library(dplyr)

#grabbing item number and text
items <- read.csv("300itemstems.csv")

# Welcome to our survey!

We want you to rate **how desirable** is it to be for someone to be, in our culture,

+ extremely high (top 1% of all people)... 
+ above average (top 30% of all people)...
+ neutral (e.g., completely average)... 
+ below average (bottom 30% of all people)..., and
+ extremely low (bottom 1% of all people)...  

...on a number of different characteristics.

Below we provide some examples of how we would like you to think and respond to “how valued” a person would be viewed by our culture, if they were deemed top 1%, top 30%, average, bottom 30% or bottom 1% for different characteristics:

## **TOP 1%:**

This means that very, very few people are “higher” than the person along the characteristic.

## **TOP 30%:**

This means that about a third of people are “higher” than the person along the characteristic. 

![](top30.PNG)

## **AVERAGE:**

This means that the person is perfectly “in the middle” along the characteristic (50% of people have “more” of the characteristic and 50% have “less). 

![](average.PNG)

## **BOTTOM 30%:**

This means that about a third of people are “lower” than the person along the characteristic. 

![](bottom30.PNG)

## **BOTTOM 1%:**

This means that very, very few people are “lower” than the person along the characteristic.

We will be recording *how long it takes for you to respond*, so please respond as quickly but accurately as possible. The next few pages will be *practice* exercises to let you become familiar with the rating procedure -- we will let you know when the practice ends and the actual data collection begins. 

```{r}
sd_next("Sample Items")

The item that you will be asked to provide ratings for is: 

**I worry about things**


```{r}
